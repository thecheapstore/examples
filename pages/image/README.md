# Image Response with Netlify Edge Functions

You can use Edge Functions to return an image. In these examples, we return an internal and external image.

## Code example

Edge Functions are files held in the `netlify/edge-functions` directory.

- [Return an internal image](../../netlify/edge-functions/image-internal.ts)
- [Return an external image](../../netlify/edge-functions/image-external.ts)
