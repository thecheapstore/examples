## Code example

Edge Functions are files held in the `netlify/edge-functions` directory.

```ts
import type { Context } from "@netlify/edge-functions";

export default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {
  // Set a cookie
  context.cookies.set({
    name: "My cookie",
    value: "hello",
  });

  // Delete a cookie
  context.cookies.delete("My cookie");

  // Read the value of a cookie
  const value = context.cookies.get("My cookie");
};
