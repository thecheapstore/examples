# Use environment variables with Netlify Edge Functions

Netlify Edge Functions support open-source Deno APIs. To access your Netlify environment variables in Edge Functions,
use the `Netlify.env` API.

## Code example

Edge Functions are files held in the `netlify/edge-functions` directory.

```ts
import type { Context } from "@netlify/edge-functions";

export default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {
  const value = Netlify.env.get("MY_IMPORTANT_VARIABLE");

  return new Response(&grave;Value of MY_IMPORTANT_VARIABLE is "&dollar;{value}".&grave;, {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
  });
};
```
