# Set custom HTTP request headers with Netlify Edge Functions

Use an Edge Function to add HTTP headers to any HTTP request at The Edge.

## Code example

Edge Functions are files held in the `netlify/edge-functions` directory.

```ts
import type { Context } from "@netlify/edge-functions";

export default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {
  const response = await context.next();
  response.headers.set("X-Your-Custom-Header", "A custom header value");
  return response;
};
```
