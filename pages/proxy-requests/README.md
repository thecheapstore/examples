# Proxy requests to another source

You can use [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) to make requests to other sources via an
Edge Function.

## Code example

Edge Functions are files held in the `netlify/edge-functions` directory.

```ts
import { Context } from "@netlify/edge-functions";

export default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {
  const joke = await fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", {
    headers: {
      Accept: "application/json",
    },
  });
  const jsonData = await joke.json();
  return Response.json(jsonData);
};
```
